        <p class="bold">"The ten greatest brownie mix tricks ever are included in this post to help you make any ordinary brownie mix into something that tastes homemade or even like it was bought from a posh bakery!"</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <!---------------- NUMBER ONE -------------->

        <p class="number"> 1 - USE A QUALITY BROWNIE MIX TO START!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> Although it may seem obvious, I can't tell you how many times I've used the incorrect brownie mix and ended up with a dish that tasted like toxins and dejection.
           <br><br>Cocoa Powder is one of my all-time favourites when it comes to brownie mixtures.
           <br><br>Your finished modified brownies will taste much better if you start with a nice brownie mix!
        </p>
        

        <!---------------- NUMBER TWO -------------->

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number"> 2 - REPLACE OIL WITH BUTTER</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> When it comes to baking, butter is my absolute favourite. While oil is recommended by most brownie mix boxes, melted butter will give your brownie mix brownies extra richness.
            <br><br>If the butter is really high quality, bonus points!</p>


        <!---------------- NUMBER THREE -------------->
        
            <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number">3 - USE EGG YOLKS RATHER THAN AN ENTIRE EGG</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> You should be aware that, normally, two egg yolks create one entire egg. In my boxed brownie recipe, I love to use two egg yolks instead of one whole egg since it keeps the brownies much more fudgy and enhances their fat content.</p>


        <!---------------- NUMBER FOUR -------------->

        <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number"> 4 - USE HEAVY CREAM / MILK IN PLACE OF WATER</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> To achieve a fudgy texture for your brownies, you should add more fat to the brownie mixture, which is where heavy cream or milk comes in.
            <br><br>Water is a boring addition to your brownie mix, when you come to think about it. It doesn't bring anything unique to the recipe; yet, for the ideal creamy, rich brownie slice, the milk or heavy cream both add extra fat, depth, and richness.</p>


        <!---------------- NUMBER FIVE -------------->

            <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number"> 5 - RATHER THAN WATER, USE HOT BREWED COFFEE</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2">Do you know what makes a match made in heaven? Cocoa and coffee together! To get that deep chocolate flavour, many chocolate cake recipes call for adding hot brewed coffee to the cake batter.
            <br><br>The same is true for these brownie mix brownies; adding coffee to the mix instead of just plain water will enhance the chocolate flavour and make it even better.</p>


        <!---------------- NUMBER SIX- -------------->

            <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number"> 6 - INCLUDE A VANILLA EXTRACT</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2">It might seem strange to add vanilla, especially considering that they are chocolate brownies. However, I assure you that the vanilla extract will enhance the flavour of the brownie's other ingredients, particularly the chocolate, by adding even more texture!!</p>


        <!--------------- NUMBER SEVEN -------------->

        <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">
                <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/video-api-prod/assets/fafe8090b4f3434f80c33b6e4ce40e24/BFV21539_BestFudgyBrownies-ThumbB1080.jpg?resize=1200:*" class="brownies" width="300px" height="300px"></a>
        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number1"> 7 - WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, ADD A TINY BIT OF SALT TO THE BOXED BROWNIE BATTER AND SPRINKLE SOME MORE ON TOP!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2">If you've ever prepared one of my recipes, you'll have noticed that I always balance out the sweetness of my baked goods with a little salt.
            <br><br>Same goes for these boxed brownies.  A tiny pinch of salt will give the batter an intriguing, rich chocolate flavour without being overly sweet.
            <br><br>Extra credit if you topped it with some sea salt because you were feeling really elegant!</p>


        <!---------------- NUMBER EIGHT -------------->

        <section class="about container" id="about">
            <div class="imgBx">

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number1"> 8 - POUR IN INSTANT COFFEE OR ESPRESSO POWDER</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> The brownie mix trick where you can use hot coffee in place of water is remarkably similar to this one. However, the reason I enjoy this one so much is that it lets you use milk as the liquid to give richness and extra fat to make your boxed brownies extra fudgy, and coffee to create that depth of flavour.
            <br><br>Use this trick to get that deep chocolate flavour in your brownie mix mixture by adding 1-2 teaspoons of espresso powder or instant coffee!</p>

        </section>

        <br>
        <p class="number1"> 9 - AVOID OVERMIXING THE BROWNIE MIX BATTER IN THE BOX</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2"> I really follow this advice for cakes and cookies, but interestingly, it also works for brownies!
            <br><br>You'll want to stir your brownie batter only until the dry mixture is completely gone; otherwise, your brownies will be dense and not fudgy. Pour the batter into your baking pan and bake it straight away.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="number1"> 10 - TO GET A REALLY FUDGY BROWNIE, ADJUST THE BAKING INSTRUCTIONS TO BAKE ON LOW AND SLOW</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pastry2">Not every brownie mix that comes in a box is the same, and many of them have varied baking directions. A toothpick inserted about an inch from the edge should come out clean or with a few dry crumbs when baking brownies made from a box. My favourite method for baking brownies is to reduce the heat to 325F and bake the brownies for 40 minutes.</p>
