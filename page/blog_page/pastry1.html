        <p class="berry1">If you've not encountered cheesecake before and the term "cheese" in the name fails to attract you, it's likely that you've questioned why cheesecake is named what it is. The name says it all!
            Cheesecake has a very unique flavour, which you could taste immediately away even if you closed your eyes and bit into a slice.
            Cream cheese serves as one of the main parts of the cheesecake recipe, which is where the dessert receives some of its flavours from. However, sugar is added to sweeten it, counteracting the strong taste of the cream cheese.
            Cheesecake tastes rather tart as well. All of these flavours, still come together to create a tasty and well-balanced dessert. The parts combine to create a flavour and texture that melts in your tongue. It is a rich and creamy dessert with a smooth and dense texture and frequently a buttery Graham cracker crust.
            Many people find cheesecake to be wonderful, however not everyone may enjoy its sweetness. There are various varieties of cheesecakes; if the traditional sort doesn't appeal to you, you might be better off going with a fruity or salted caramel one!</p>

        <div id="crinkles"></div>

        <p class="berry1">Brownies are a popular treat that are delectable chocolate-flavored squares with a soft, sticky texture. Chocolate, eggs, butter, sugar, flour, salt, and vanilla extract are typically found in a brownie batter. 
            Even though the parts are the same as those of chocolate cake, the best brownie recipes frequently have a crackly top and a fudge-like texture. A chocolate brownie that's ideal will have a crispy surface and a soft, creamy inside. 
            This baked treat dessert goes well with a glass of milk, ice cream, or just by itself. There are many various flavor combinations of brownies, including cream cheese brown recipe brownies and fudge brownies.</p>

            <div id="eggpie"></div>

            <p class="berry1"> Chocolate Crinkles are a very soft cookie that resembles brownies and is covered with a thick layer of confectioners' sugar, also known as icing sugar. 
                The reason for the name "Crinkle" is most likely related to the way the powdered sugar "crinkles" or "cracks" while the cookies bake, exposing a tiny bit of baked chocolate. This must be why they are often referred to as "Black and Whites". 
                These Chocolate Crinkles are so incredibly soft and practically melt in your mouth that I adore eating them warm straight out of the oven.</p>

            <p class="berry1"> Filipino egg pies are mouthwatering foods that have a custard-like texture. Despite being well-known in the Philippines and even seen in neighbourhood bakeries, this mouthwatering dessert hasn't quite established its own identity and is frequently mistaken for a gigantic egg custard or another dish. 
                Egg pie is a delicious Filipino pie filled with egg custard and topped with egg whites that give it a distinctive toasty brown colour. Flour, sugar, milk, butter, and eggs are used in its making. You may also add zest or calamansi juice. It's a kind of pie with custard. In the Philippines, bakeries frequently sell egg pies.</p>

            <br><br><br>
            <p class="berry1"> It is a thin, long loaf of bread with a soft inside and a crunchy outside. It's neither salty, nor is it sweet. A baguette is best enjoyed with butter (or margarine) and jam, or on its own if you're following a diet.
                Despite the long preparation stages, the thing that makes a baguette exceptional is its simplicity. A typical baguette simply requires four simple ingredients: yeast, water, flour (ideally French flour), and salt.
                It's a little challenging to describe the flavour of baguette in words. The most popular bread in France is baguette, which is so common that it's challenging to characterize in comparison to other bread varieties!</p>
